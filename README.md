# TrueShuffle

True shuffle is an Android application that can be used to shuffle playlists in a truly random way.
There are currently two shuffle methods:

- Shuffle - Creates a copy of the playlist with all the songs shuffled in a completely random order.
- Limit - Creates a copy of the playlist, but limits the maximum number of songs from any one artist
  to a specified limit. For example, if a playlist has 5 songs from artist A and 15 songs from
  artist B, and 10 was specified as the limit, all 5 of artist A's songs and 10 randomly selected
  songs from artist B would be in the shuffled playlist.
